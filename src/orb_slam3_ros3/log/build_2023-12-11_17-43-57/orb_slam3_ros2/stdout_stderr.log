[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_msg_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_msg_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_msg_interface" with any of the following names:

    custom_msg_interfaceConfig.cmake
    custom_msg_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_msg_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "custom_msg_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "custom_msg_interface" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
